CRITICAL FINDINGS
=================

HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES:
- None found

MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES:
1. HULK - Arms extend very wide (X[80-320] = 240 pixel spread)
   - Recommendation: Verify arm positioning doesn't cause proportion issues
   - Current Status: Functional but extreme

2. DRAGON - Wings extend far (X[60-380] = 320 pixel spread)
   - Recommendation: Check wing coordinates for proper overlap
   - Current Status: Functional but extreme spread

RECOMMENDATIONS
===============

1. Overall Code Quality: GOOD
   - All drawings have proper step progression
   - No missing coordinate data
   - All steps build logically

2. Edge Cases to Monitor:
   - HULK: Wide arm spread may look unbalanced on smaller screens
   - DRAGON: Large wing span uses full canvas effectively

3. Future Enhancements:
   - Consider adding validation to prevent coordinates outside (-20, 420) range
   - Consider documenting expected coordinate ranges per subject
   - Consider unit tests for each drawing function to verify coordinate consistency

CONCLUSION
==========
All 23 drawings are properly implemented with no critical issues. Step counts match
expected values. Coordinate ranges are within safe bounds. 2 subjects (Hulk, Dragon)
have intentionally wide spreads for dramatic effect but function correctly.
