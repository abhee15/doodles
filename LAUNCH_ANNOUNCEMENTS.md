Hi everyone! 👋

I just launched **Doodles** - a collection of free educational games for kids ages 7-12. All games run directly in the browser, no downloads or sign-ups required.

**What's included:**

🪜 **Math Ladder** - Climb by solving addition/subtraction problems (timer-based)
🥷 **Number Ninja** - Click falling numbers in order (sequencing practice)
⚡ **Quick Math** - Learn Vedic math tricks like the ×11 shortcut
📖 **Word Explorer** - Build vocabulary with 3 interactive word games
🌍 **World Explorer** - Learn countries, capitals, flags, and fun facts

**Why I built this:**
Educational games should be accessible to everyone. No paywalls, no ads (for now), just pure learning fun. Kids can practice math, improve vocabulary, and learn geography through engaging gameplay.

**Tech stack:** Built with Phaser 3, vanilla JavaScript, hosted on GitHub Pages. Fully responsive and works on tablets/phones.

**Feedback welcome!** This is v1.0 - I'd love suggestions for new games or features.

Hope your kids enjoy it! 🎓

• Quick Math - Vedic math mental shortcuts
