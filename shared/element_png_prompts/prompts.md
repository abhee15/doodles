Element PNG prompts — artist-ready

Notes for artist: Each prompt is sized for a square PNG (2000x2000 px recommended). Keep characters child-friendly, clear silhouettes, and a limited color palette per image to aid quick recognition. Include soft textures and gentle lighting; avoid photo realism. Each file should be named using the element number and symbol prefix: 01_H_Hydrogen.png, 02_He_Helium.png, etc.

Usage: These prompts are ready for both illustrator briefs and AI image generation. For AI, prepend: "square PNG, child-friendly illustration, 2000x2000, flat color shading, soft textures, no photorealism, high readability". For artist commissions include filename, palette, and composition notes from each item above.
